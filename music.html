              <textarea name="textarea" cols="55" rows="12" readonly="readonly" >  In 1955, Chuck Berry invented rock and roll. He is a black man plays black music and white kids where listening to rhythm and blues. Rock Music was promoted by Elvis Presley.  Rock and roll  was inherited by  white singers, such as Presley, who often performed songs composed by black musicians. White rockers became gentler and gentler, thereby drowining rock and roll's very reason to exists. &#10;  The kids' malaise returned, with a much taller wave, when folksingers started singing about the problems of the system. Kids who had not identified with Woody Guthrie's stories of poor people, identified immediately with folksingers singing about the Vietnam war and civil rights. Bob Dylan was arguably the most influential musician of the era. He led the charge against the Establishment with simple songs and poetic lyrics. A generation believed in him and followed his dreams. Music became the expression of youth's ambitions. &#10;
			 In the early Sixties veterans of that scene, or disciples of that scene, led to the formation of bands such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds and the Animals. The Rolling Stones became "the" sensation in London and went on to record the most successful singles of the era. The Yardbirds were the most experimental of them all, and became the training ground for three of the greatest guitarists ever: Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimi Page. From their ashes two blues bands were born, the Cream and the Led Zeppelin, that in a few years will revolutionize rock music again.
